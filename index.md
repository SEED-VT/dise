        <h2>Workshop Overview</h2>
        <p>Modern software systems are becoming increasingly data-intensive. They process massive quantities of data and also produce large-scale, machine-generated data, such as traces and telemetry, which is used for runtime monitoring, log analysis, debugging, and testing. These analytical pipelines are performance-critical, and their behavior is highly dependent on the scale and content of the data they process.</p>
        <p>To thrive at this scale, software organizations need intelligent AI agents that can not only process the data but also reason about it within the context of the software. Integrating AI-driven, data-informed feedback loops is essential for autonomous software operations and context-aware guidance to developers. Achieving trustworthy AI-native software engineering demands addressing challenges that directly influence the robustness, reliability, and trustworthiness of data-intensive systems.</p>
        <h3>Key Challenges</h3>
        <p>Trustworthy AI-enabled software engineering faces several reinforcing challenges in data-intensive environments:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Data-dependent uncertainty.</strong> The dynamic nature of large-scale, machine-generated data complicates comprehensive testing and debugging, and agentic approaches can amplify diagnosis uncertainty.</li>
          <li><strong>Massive scale.</strong> Operational data overwhelms traditional analysis, demanding systems-level optimization for storage, tracing, and monitoring where critical behaviors manifest only at production scale.</li>
          <li><strong>Stringent latency requirements.</strong> Real-time or near real-time expectations leave little room for offline analysis; long-running workloads make techniques like fuzzing difficult to apply at scale.</li>
          <li><strong>Robustness under evolving conditions.</strong> Shifting data distributions and infrastructure conditions require AI techniques that remain stable despite drift, adversarial inputs, and noisy telemetry.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Workshop Goals</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide a forum for advancing software engineering research around data-intensive development, debugging, monitoring, and testing.</li>
          <li>Highlight AI-driven, data-informed feedback loops that enable autonomous operations and context-aware guidance.</li>
          <li>Launch a community consortium dedicated to curating and maintaining industry-scale synthetic datasets, benchmarks, and bug corpora.</li>
